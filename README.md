# Weather-Website
HTML:
   The HTML structure includes a header with the app title, a section for displaying the current weather information, and an input field for the user to enter the location.
CSS:
   The CSS styles create a clean and user-friendly interface, with a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
   Use different styles to represent various weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy).
JavaScript:
   JavaScript fetches weather data from a weather API based on the user's location input.
   The app displays the current temperature, weather conditions, and possibly additional information such as humidity or wind speed.
   Implement error handling for invalid inputs or failed API requests
